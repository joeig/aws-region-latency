<h1>Region Latency Meter</h1>

<p>
    This service measures the HTTPS latency from your browser to AWS regions, by requesting regional DynamoDB endpoints.
</p>

<p>
    All test requests are performed twice, in order to demonstrate potential differences between the initial request and
    the second request.
    Subsequent requests can potentially benefit from established TCP and TLS sessions, thus have reduced network
    overhead.
